# Random Quote Generator

This repository contains the source code for a random quote generator, built using **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**.  

## Overview  

The Random Quote Generator displays inspirational quotes along with their authors at the click of a button. Unlike API-based generators, this project uses a locally stored JavaScript object containing a collection of quotes and randomly selects one to display. Itâ€™s a simple yet engaging project that highlights the use of JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and responsive UI design.
